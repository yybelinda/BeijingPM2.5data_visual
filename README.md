# BeijingPM2.5data_visual
some plots on Beijing air condition, PM2.5 data, which are not fully verified or validated, measured by U.S. Department of State

The data is available as "Beijing - Historical Data" here: http://www.stateair.net/web/historical/1/1.html
As the Data Use Statement suggested, hereby I confirm I noticed that 
	"The data and information are in no way official."
	"... these data are not fully verified or validated."
	"... give attribution to the U.S. Department of State."
  
As the webpage showed that the data set is provided as .csv files from 2008 upto now.
